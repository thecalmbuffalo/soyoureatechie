    <title>So You're a Techie</title>

<h1>Being a techie is like being a Jedi</h1>

<p>I decided to make this webpage on my github account rather than my wordpress account.
The reason I decided to do this is because I love technology and have a drive for learning.
I'm also a bit of a show-off and would like to develop my skills as a developer. This experience
is rather new to me but I wish I had started doing this when I was a kid, but instead I was
playing "Sonic the Hedgehog". Which is not a big deal since there is no point on wanting to
change the things that I'm not able to change.</p>
    
<h1>I digress</h1>

<p>As I grow in my skills as a technologist, I have learned some things that I would like to 
share with other techies who are wanting to learn more skills. In technology, there is a good
incentive to have business skills. This is what seperated the greats, i.e. Steve Jobs, Bill Gates,
Elon Musk, from the rest of the world. I want to be great! I'm glad you do too. Part of the reason I
am explaining my ambitions is to inspire you to do the same thing. I hope you realize by now that 
the other reason I'm explaining this is due to federal regulations that require me to inform you that
this website includes affiliate links that track your online activity and pay me a commission when
you make an online purchase.</p>

<h1>My name is not Frank</h1>

<p>My intention here is to inform you. I want to show you how all this computer magic works. I want you
to learn to have patience as I have learned to have. But I realize that some of you are going to have a 
time constraint, and this is where the affiliate links come in. I will not try and sell you junk products.
Many times, while being new to technology, I had to buckle down and learn these concepts because I just didn't 
have any money. But, I welcome you to make this easier on yourself and download the software I recommend. The
reason I tell you this is because as of this publishing I probably haven't used any of this software myself. What
this software probably does is automate the process of what my instructions include.</p>

<h1>Feel free to leave feedback</h1>

<p>You're welcome to e-mail me with any feedback. Whether is be questions, concerns, or suggestions I am 
always willing to learn about you even if you tell me I'm doing it all wrong I won't mind.</p>
